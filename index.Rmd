title: "The Close KinGdom"
description: Welcome to a nascent site about using Close-Kin Mark Recapture (CKMR) to estimate demographic parameters from fish and wildlife populations.
site: distill::distill_website
---



We will be building this site out over the next several months, intending
to place a whole series of examples that will let researchers and managers
new to CKMR familiarize themselves with its principles and practice, and to learn how to code CKMR models in R and TMB 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
