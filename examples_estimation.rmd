Here, we are developing a list of worked examples, assuming that kin finding was already accomplished in a previous step of analysis.  

* [*Adults the same--*](./adults_the_same.html) This example describes the situation where all adults reach sexual maturity at the same time, have the same reproductive and survival parameters, where age is known exactly, and where sampling is conducted at discrete annual intervals (e.g., in a multi-year study).

* *Aging error--* This example examines implications of aging error on estimation, including CKMR models that account for aging error by integrating over possible ages of animals
